# RSerrano_TeamProfileGenerator
This is a application that uses both Inquirer, and Jest JSON packages to generate a team profile. This will include classes for an employee, engineer, intern, and a manager. Each individual will have a name and contact info.

To use the application, one must open up the terminal and type npm i in order to install the necessary packages if they have not been installed already.

Afterwards you will be propmpted with a series of questions asking for your name, ID, email, and role. Was unable to get a html to generate, and was unable to seperate each class with their corresponding questions. 

Will continue to work on it in the future, however, last update is... 10/06/2021.
